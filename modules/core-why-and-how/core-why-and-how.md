# Why and how?

---

## Why programming?

- Hopefully you don't seriously need to ask this question...
--

- Because software is an incredibly exciting __medium for artistic expression__
- Because software __pays the bills__
- Because software is __how the world works now__
- And __programming is how we create software__

---

## Why JavaScript?

- Because it is the __language of interactivity__ on the web
- Because it is a __good learning language__
- Because it is __incredibly popular__
- Because it has __countless libraries and extensions available__
- Because it is __not just for the web__

???

- Pretty much every fancy thing you see a web page do is done with JavaScript
- JavaScript is a great learning language because so many people use it for so many tasks. For any question you have, there is likely an answer online. For any genre of program you want to write, there is probably a community online.
- Perhaps most importantly for learning, JavaScript is a modern language with the standard suite of features we expect to see. Your knowledge of JavaScript will allow you to learn other languages much, much more easily.
- JavaScript has been around for a long time and has had many, many libraries and extensions created for it that give you greater power with less work! (More on this later in the course.)
- JavaScript isn't limited to programming for the web. With technologies like [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) you can build your own applications in JavaScript

---

## Why p5.js?

- p5.js is a web-native, __JavaScript version of [Processing](https://processing.org/)__, the popular teaching environment
- It provides a __thoughtful and constrained set of elements__ to learn programming with
- Importantly, it allows us to __create visual programs quickly and easily__
- Check out some __[examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)__

---

## Why games and playful interaction?

- Because games and playful interaction are __computation intensive__
- Because if we can program a game, we can __program pretty much anything__
- Because __it's just more fun__ to practice programming with games and play

## How do you know?

- As we delve into programming question arises: "How the heck am I supposed to _know_ the names and parameters and effects of all this stuff???"
--

- It's a good question, and the answer is: __documentation__
- __Nobody "just knows"__ all the possible functions and their parameters
- All of us are _constantly_ looking things up to remember them or to find new things
- Getting used to reading documentation is a crucial skill
--

- For now, the most important documentation for us is [The p5 Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/).

---

## The p5 Reference

- Go to https://p5js.org/reference/
--

- As you can see, it provides you with a list of __every function that p5 provides__
- In a very real sense, this collection of functions _is p5_, this is what it does
- There are two obvious ways to use the reference:
--

  - First, you can _look up_ the specifics of a function you're trying to use
--

  - Second, you can _browse_ the reference to discover new possibilities!
--

- The reference is especially nice in that it pretty much always provides example code that illustrates what a function does

---

## Use the reference!

- It's not rocket science to say that if you're uncertain about how a function works your _first_ action should be to read the appropriate page in the reference
- Unsure of what the first two numbers you give the `ellipse()` function mean?
--
 Go to the [`ellipse()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse) page in the reference and find out they are the (x,y) coordinates for the ellipse!
--

- Wondering how to generate a random number?
--
 Search the reference for the word "random" and find the [`random()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) page that tells you how to do it!
--

- Of course, be aware that you might run into things you don't understand yet
- But by the end of the course __every single thing in the reference will be understandable to you__

---

## The Reference!

- Don't forget you don't have to memorise everything!
- Use the reference!
- Be happy!

https://p5js.org/reference/

???

- With the reference in mind, I will spend a lot less time laboring over every detail of every function we learn
- Instead, if you have any doubts
  - you can look things up and check for yourself!
  - And of course you can ask me or the TA or anyone in shouting distance!

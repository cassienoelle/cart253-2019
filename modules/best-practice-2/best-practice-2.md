# Reading the manual

---

## How do you know?

- As we delve into programming question arises: "How the heck am I supposed to _know_ the names and parameters and effects of all this stuff???"
--

- It's a good question, and the answer is: __documentation__
- __Nobody "just knows"__ all the possible functions and their parameters
- All of us are _constantly_ looking things up to remember them or to find new things
- Getting used to reading documentation is a crucial skill
--

- For now, the most important documentation for us is [The p5 Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/).

---

## The p5 Reference

- Go to https://p5js.org/reference/
--

- As you can see, it provides you with a list of __every function that p5 provides__
- In a very real sense, this collection of functions _is p5_, this is what it does
- There are two obvious ways to use the reference:
--

  - First, you can _look up_ the specifics of a function you're trying to use
--

  - Second, you can _browse_ the reference to discover new possibilities!
--

- The reference is especially nice in that it pretty much always provides example code that illustrates what a function does

---

## Use the reference!

- It's not rocket science to say that if you're uncertain about how a function works your _first_ action should be to read the appropriate page in the reference
- Unsure of what the first two numbers you give the `ellipse()` function mean?
--
 Go to the [`ellipse()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse) page in the reference and find out they are the (x,y) coordinates for the ellipse!
--

- Wondering how to generate a random number?
--
 Search the reference for the word "random" and find the [`random()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) page that tells you how to do it!
--

- Of course, be aware that you might run into things you don't understand yet
- But by the end of the course __every single thing in the reference will be understandable to you__

---

## The Reference!

- Don't forget you don't have to memorise everything!
- Use the reference!
- Be happy!

???

- With the reference in mind, I will spend a lot less time laboring over every detail of every function we learn
- Instead, if you have any doubts
  - you can look things up and check for yourself!
  - And of course you can ask me or the TA or anyone in shouting distance!

### Best Practice 2 / CART 253 / Fall 2018 / Pippin Barr

# Reading the manual

---

## But...

- A question arises: "How the heck am I supposed to _know_ the names and parameters and effects of all this stuff???"
--

- It's a good question, and the answer for us is [The Processing Reference](http://www.processing.org/reference).
- In fact, _no_ programmer "just knows" all the possible functions and their parameters
- All of us are _constantly_ looking things up in the reference to remember them or to find new things
- Getting used to reading the reference is a crucial skill

---

## Remember the Reference

- Don't forget you don't have to _memorise_ everything
- _Use the reference!_

???

- With the reference in mind, I will spend a lot less time laboring over every detail of every function we learn
- Instead, if you have any doubts you can
  - Ask me, obviously
  - But more importantly, you can look things up and check for yourself!

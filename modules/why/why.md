## Why JavaScript?

- Because it is the __language of interactivity__ on the web

- Pretty much every fancy thing you see a web page do is done with JavaScript
- JavaScript is a great learning language because so many people use it for so many tasks. For any question you have, there is likely an answer online. For any genre of program you want to write, there is probably a community online.
- Perhaps most importantly for learning, JavaScript is a modern language with the standard suite of features we expect to see. Your knowledge of JavaScript will allow you to learn other languages much, much more easily.
- JavaScript has been around for a long time and has had many, many libraries and extensions created for it that give you greater power with less work! (More on this later in the course.)
- JavaScript isn't limited to programming for the web. With technologies like [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) you can build your own applications in JavaScript

## Course schedule

- The course schedule is at https://www.github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2018/wiki/Course-Schedule
- There is a section for each week that will contain slides, notes, resources, assignments, etc.
- These slides are written in [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) which allows text written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to be displayed as slides
- When viewing the slides, press `F` for full-screen and `P` for presenter view
- This also means they can be viewed as documents online, including the presenter notes which contain more detail
- My aim will be to include relevant resources for each module we cover, and you should feel free to let me know about things you find so I can add them

- This is an example of a presenter note which can be seen in the 'document' version of this presentation

# Exercise 8 - Project 3 Prototype 2

__Grade__: 2.5% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 19 November 2018.

## Brief

In short: __create a new and different prototype for a part of Project 3__. This should __not__ be the same as what you produced for Exercise 7.

In longer: conceptualise, design, and implement a prototype of a different specific aspect of Project 3. This should be a specific slice of what you envisage for your final project: use the exercise to explore one key idea/interaction/visual effect/something you want to include in the final project and to implement it as a working, well-constructed prototype. As such, this exercise is an opportunity to come up with and explore one idea for the project (note that it is not mandatory to actually include this idea in the final project itself).


## Learning objectives

- Conceptualising and designing a specific project of your own
- Scoping your prototype to make sure it is of an appropriate size to get done in a week


## Requirements

The actual nature of your prototype will of course depend on your idea for your final project, so there are no detailed requirements. However, the prototype should:

- Be interactive (e.g. the user provides input and the software responds in some way)
- Be creative (e.g. not a simple re-skin of pre-existing code)
- Communicate an idea (e.g. the interactive experience should be about something specific)
- Include a description of where you envisage the project going from this prototype at the top of your script file (e.g. you have an initial understanding of the larger project as well the prototype)

In short, it should be reflective of one part of a larger idea for a project. Note that the scale of work for the prototype should be roughly equivalent to past exercises (with the understanding that you are not starting with specific code to change). It is perfectly acceptable to cannabalise pre-existing code from the course and your own previous work, just make sure you indicate this in your commenting.


## Submission

You will submit this exercise as a __comment__ on an __Issue__ on the course repository here:

https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2018/issues

(Click on the Issue with the name of the exercise and your section letter and follow the instructions.)


## Grading

Grading for exercises will consider the following categories:

- __Implementation__ (40%)- the code runs, meets the challenges set, includes any further changes, has no errors, is interesting/creative, etc.,
- __Structure__ (30%) - the code is well organised, makes good use of variables, functions, object-oriented programming, has comments indicating new code, etc.
- __Style__ (30%) - the code is well-commented, well-formatted and indented, uses good names for variables, functions, classes, etc., and has a good number of commits with well-written commit messages (commits include the prefix "P2:")

Each element will be graded as follows:

- __Excellent__ (A-range) - Meets requirements perfectly
- __Good__ (B-range) - Meets requirements with some minor issues
- __Adequate__ (C-range) - Meets requirements but with clear issues
- __Poor__ (D-range) - Barely meets requirements
- __Non-submission / Unacceptable__ (F)

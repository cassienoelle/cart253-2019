__Grade__: 2.5% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 22 October 2018.

## Brief

Modify the OOP version of the Pong game to recreate your [Exercise 4](Exercise-4.md) version.

## Learning objectives

## NEW: Commenting your changes clearly

For this exercise and all future exercises you must add a comment above and below any new code you add or code you change in your program to indicate it is something to be graded. (See [Exercise 4](Exercise-4.md) text for an example.)

## Challenges

As always, begin by downloading the starter code ([exercise5.zip](exercise5.zip)). Add it to your repository and commit it as "__Ex5: Started exercise 5__". Then complete and commit each challenge below separately with a descriptive commit messages (__including the exercise prefix "Ex5:"__). Remember to comment your work.

This week, the challenge is to recreate your [Exercise-4](Exercise-4.md) version of Pong in the new Object-Oriented version of Pong represented by the starter code. This will mean:

- Tracking the score (consider the idea of having the Ball's `isOffScreen()` function either return which side of the screen it went off, or neither if it's still on screen - you could represent this with numbers or strings)
- Displaying the score
- Launching the ball with a random y velocity toward the paddle that won the most recent point
- Altering the visuals as per your previous version

In short, make the object-oriented version look and feel the same as the non-object-oriented version you made last week.

Optional challenges: Feel free to pursue last week's optional challenges in this new context.

## Grading

Grading for exercises will consider the following categories:

- __Implementation__ (40%)- the code runs, meets the challenges set, includes any further changes, has no errors, is interesting/creative, etc.,
- __Structure__ (30%) - the code is well organised, makes good use of variables, functions, object-oriented programming, has comments indicating new code, etc.
- __Style__ (30%) - the code is well-commented, well-formatted and indented, uses good names for variables, functions, classes, etc., and has a good number of commits with well-written commit messages (commits include the prefix "P2:")

Each element will be graded as follows:

- __Excellent__ (A-range) - Meets requirements perfectly
- __Good__ (B-range) - Meets requirements with some minor issues
- __Adequate__ (C-range) - Meets requirements but with clear issues
- __Poor__ (D-range) - Barely meets requirements
- __Non-submission / Unacceptable__ (F)

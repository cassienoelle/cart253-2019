# Project 3 - The Grand Finale

__Grade__: 30% of final grade (see grading guidelines at bottom)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on 4 December 2018 (Section B) or 6 December (Section A) (Four weeks.)


## Brief

This final project has an open brief: you are allowed to create anything you wish, whether it is a game, a visualisation, a simulation, musical toy, a conceptual art piece, or something else. The final result should be something you would like to put on your portfolio website.

__However__, unless you have a great deal of confidence in your abilities, it is advisable to _begin_ by thinking about the various kinds of code structures you _already know_ (e.g. moving things with velocity, bouncing, drawing shapes and images, checking for overlaps/collisions, using oscillators, 3D shapes, playing sounds, etc.) and focusing your design on ideas that can be accomplished with those structures. That is, if in doubt, you could create a kind of collage of the ideas we've covered in class. You're free to use any of the sample code provided throughout the course.

__Push yourself__, though. Make sure you do try to learn new things in order to accomplish your vision. Ask for help with this!


## Learning objectives

- Combining all the skills and concepts used in the course into a cohesive piece of creative software
- Exploring the creation of meaningful experiences through software


## Requirements

### Technical

Because this is the final project for an introductory course on programming, the key requirement is that you exhibit all the skills we have learned about over the course. At a minimum, this should include:

- Interactivity (the user can interact with the software and it reacts to their input)
- Appropriate inclusion of variables, functions, conditionals, loops
- Object-Oriented Programming (the software is created using classes)
- Arrays (the software uses one or more arrays)
- The use of at least one p5 library (e.g. any library listed on this page: https://p5js.org/libraries/)

### Creative

The central creative requirement for this project is that you produce software that has _meaning_. That is, the interactions, visuals, sounds, etc. should all _combine to create a specific, designed experience_. Thus, you might make a game about love, a simulation about social media addiction, sound toy about ancient greek theatre, a conceptual art piece about the meaningless of existence, etc. In short, your software needs to have something to say.

### Overall

The key is to make a novel, creative, and meaningful piece of software that shows your abilities at programming in JavaScript with p5.


## Submission

You will submit this project as a __comment__ on an __Issue__ on the course repository here:

https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253-2018/issues

(Click on the Issue with the name of the project and your section letter and follow the instructions.)


## Grading

Grading for projects will consider the following categories:

- __Implementation__ (40%)- the code runs, meets the requirements set, has no errors, is interesting/creative, etc., represents a serious amount of work
- __Structure__ (30%) - the code is well organised, makes good use of variables, functions, object-oriented programming, has comments indicating new code, etc.
- __Style__ (30%) - the code is well-commented, well-formatted and indented, uses good names for variables, functions, classes, etc., and has a good number of commits with well-written commit messages (commits include the prefix "P3:")

Each category for the project will be graded as follows:

- __Excellent__ (A-range) - Meets requirements perfectly
- __Good__ (B-range) - Meets requirements with some minor issues
- __Adequate__ (C-range) - Meets requirements but with clear issues
- __Poor__ (D-range) - Barely meets requirements
- __Non-submission / Unacceptable__ (F)
